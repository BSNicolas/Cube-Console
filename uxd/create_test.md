With this test sessions I was able to identify strengths and weaknesses of my product :

**positive aspect :**   

- the console is easy to handle
- buttons are fine
- the physical design is nice
- the restart option is good

**negative aspect :**   

- importance of showing controls
- the joystick is too sensitive
- have a screen at the end of the game with the score
- make the middle button useful
- make a game over screen when we lose
- why the led is blinking ?
